  * initramfs-tools.8: Add more docs about boot args, s/2.6.15/2.6.17/.

  * scripts/functions: Simplify parse_numeric() by arithmetic calculation,
    instead of working on it's representation. Thanks to tarski.
    (launchpad.net/21759) Much more elegant than the 0.58 version fix.

    before attempting to parse also check for the right field.

  * init: Check for root=/dev/nfs. Parse ip kernel command line for nfsroot.
    Drop undocumented and not compliant nfsopts.

  * scripts/nfs: Add ip parsing conforming to Documentation/nfsroot.txt.

  * scripts/local: mountroot add message what to check if root is not found

  * update-initramfs: Show by default which initramfs gets generated.
    (closes: #364301)

  * Resync with 0.40ubuntu32:
   -  Make prereqs conditional on the script/hook actually existing.  From
      now on, this means that 'PREREQ="udev"' means "run udev first, iff it
      happens to be installed".  Having the files exist on the filesystem if
      you have a HARD dependency should be enforced with package dependencies.
      (closes: #369617)
   -  Make "update-initramfs -u" try to find the running kernel *after* it
      attempts to search the symbolic link list and its own sha1 list.
      Using this as a fallback, rather than the default, should solve most
      upgrade issues, where people found their initramfs was half-baked.
   -  Abstract out the kernel minversion checking stuff into the function
      library, so we can reuse it to check minversion requirements for hook
      scripts as well (such as udev, which requires >= 2.6.15 in dapper)
   -  Bump the kernel minversion to 2.6.15 on hppa and ia64, since they used
      initrd-tools with their 2.6.12 kernels in breezy, not initramfs-tools.
   -  If mkinitramfs fails due to minversion not being met, don't bail out
      of update-initramfs, but just exit 0, so upgrades don't halt on it.

  * debian/initramfs-tools.postrm: We no longer need to explicitly remove
    /etc/initramfs-tools/modules.

initramfs-tools (0.40ubuntu30) dapper; urgency=low

  * This release brought to you by Fujitsu hard drives, which have forced
    me to rewrite all my most recent initramfs-tools changes from memory.
  * Include arcmsr module in the scsi module list (launchpad.net/40075)
  * Abstract out the kernel minversion checking stuff into the function
    library, so we can reuse it to check minversion requirements for hook
    scripts as well (such as udev, which requires >= 2.6.15 in dapper)
  * Bump the kernel minversion to 2.6.15 on hppa and ia64, since they used
    initrd-tools with their 2.6.12 kernels in breezy, not initramfs-tools.
  * If mkinitramfs fails due to minversion not being met, don't bail out
    of update-initramfs, but just exit 0, so upgrades don't halt on it.
  * Conditionalise the use of lvm and md in mkinitramfs so it's a no-op if
    you don't have those packages installed, but allows for smooth upgrades
    if you have older versions that don't ship their own hooks yet.
  * Make prereqs conditional on the script/hook actually existing.  From
    now on, this means that 'PREREQ="udev"' means "run udev first, iff it
    happens to be installed".  Having the files exist on the filesystem if
    you have a HARD dependency should be enforced with package dependencies.
  * Add ohci1394 and sbp2 to the scsi module list (launchpad.net/37479)
  * Move framebuffer setup from usplash to scripts/local-top/framebuffer
    so that people booting with vga=1234 but no splash will still get a

  * Move /proc and /sys to the real filesystem, rather than unmounting them;
    slightly reduces workload.
  * Replace /root with ${rootmnt} in final usage of /dev/console
  * Copy across modprobe blacklist as well as aliases

  * Change the panic/breaknow thing *again*.  There's now a break= option
    which can be any of top, modules, premount, mount, bottom, init and
    causes the initramfs to break at that point.  panic/breaknow is now
    break=top, without an argument is equivalent to break=premount.
  * Run depmod at the top of the init script, so init-top scripts can use
    modprobe.

  "The public is wonderfully tolerant. It forgives everything except
   genius."

    Add RESUME= support.

  * scripts/functions: Be silent when adding non-detected modules.

  * conf/mkinitramfs.conf: MODULES=most by default, BUSYBOX=y
    (Non-busybox isn't supported now.  It's not clear that it ever
     will be).  Add RESUME line for resuming from suspend-to-disk.

  * scripts/local-premount/suspend: New script for suspend-to-disk.

  * debian/control: Bump depends on busybox-cvs-initramfs to
    20040623-1ubuntu19.  Add dependancy on lvm2.
    Bump standards version to 3.6.2.0 (no-op)

  * debian/control:
    Force version depend on lvm2 (>= 2.01.04-5) to make sure newer kernels
    will boot.
    Thanks for Andrew Mitchell for discovering this.

  * hooks/: New directory

  * debian/dirs: Move hooks to ...
  * debian/initramfs-tools.install: ... here.

  - Oscar Wilde

  * mkinitramfs: Handle putting DSDT.aml into the initramfs

    addons.

  - Oscar Wilde

  * scripts/functions: Add scsi_boot_events and call it to load sd_mod

  * scripts/local-top/md: Autodetect raid level

    the root device.  Don't bother with lvm if the root partition isn't
    /dev/mapper/FOO.

  * scripts/functions: Fix ide_boot_events.  This never worked, even
    if I thought it did.

  * init: init variable should be lower case.  Exported ROOT variable
    should be upper case.

initramfs-tools (0.13) breezy; urgency=low

initramfs-tools (0.10) breezy; urgency=low

  The "I can see you!" release.

  * Unconditionally require busybox.  Might revert this eventually
    but it's too much of a pain right now do this without
    a reasonably environment

  * Use modprobe to load modules

  * Iterate through /sys/bus/pci and /sys/bus/usb and load drivers
    based on their modalias

  * Start to use /sbin for things

  * Include depmod in the image.  Use it at boot time.

  The "We are one in the spirit..." release

    can see them.

  * Honour command line 'ro' or 'rw' settings for nfs.

 -- Jeff Bailey <jbailey@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 14 Jun 2005 21:35:14 +0000

initramfs-tools (0.7) breezy; urgency=low

  The "CONFORM!" release.

  * Make command line arguments almost match mkinitrd.  The -m argument
    doesn't make any sense, so it's not supported.  Add support for
    overriding the confdir, and specifying version no longer expects -v.

  * Add sed and grep to the initramfs for now.  Will prune these
    eventually, but for now mdrun needs them.

  * Add mdadm and mdrun to the initramfs.

  * Add hookscript directories.

  * Call hookscripts

  Thanks to David Weinhall <tao@acc.umu.se> for the dependancy-based
  hookscripts.

  * arch:all, not arch:any
