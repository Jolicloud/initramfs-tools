initramfs-tools (0.39) unstable; urgency=medium

   * Setting urgency to medium to get this into testing.  This
     will make life easier for d-i.

  * Revert the mklibs-small usage patch - reduces needed dependencies:
    hook-fuctions: Readds copy_exec.
    mkinitramfs, hooks/{evms,lvm,md}: Use copy_exec.

  * mkinitramfs: Newer udev no longer uses /sbin/udev - remove usage.
    (Closes: #339568, #339365, #338814)

  * Pump udev dependency.

  * init: Pump timeout as there is currently no way to check which udevd
    processes are still running and why. 
    Cures hopefully breakage of missing devices on boot.

  * Sync with latest Ubuntu.

initramfs-tools (0.7) breezy; urgency=low

  The "CONFORM!" release.

  * Make command line arguments almost match mkinitrd.  The -m argument
    doesn't make any sense, so it's not supported.  Add support for
    overriding the confdir, and specifying version no longer expects -v.

  * Add sed and grep to the initramfs for now.  Will prune these
    eventually, but for now mdrun needs them.

  * Add mdadm and mdrun to the initramfs.

  * Add hookscript directories.

  * Call hookscripts

  Thanks to David Weinhall <tao@acc.umu.se> for the dependancy-based
  hookscripts.

  * Add commandline parameters for NFSROOT and BOOT.

  * Moving loading of boot functions to after commandline parsing.

  * Allow NFSROOT variable to be set to auto to pick up value from DHCP
    Server.
